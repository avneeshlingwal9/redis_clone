### **1. What is your project about?**

**Structure:**

* Problem statement in 1‚Äì2 sentences
* Tech stack mention
* Highlight 1‚Äì2 standout features

Example:

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a web-based library management system that automates book issue/return tracking.
> Built using C++, MySQL, and REST APIs.
> The key feature is a real-time availability check, optimized using indexing on the `books` table.‚Äù

If you want, I can now **merge this Project Q\&A Sheet + the 15 Coding Problems + 20 MCQs** into a single PDF ‚ÄúJTG One-Day Prep Kit‚Äù so you can go through everything in order without switching contexts. That will make your last-day prep much smoother.

Do you want me to make that PDF for you?
